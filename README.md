# Assignment5_Maze
I modeled my maze game after a cave because there is always a claustrophobic and liminal feeling of a cave. This feeling of a cave is just like the feeling of a maze. I also chose a blue colour for the crystals because it feels more magical and bright. Finally, I made a miner in overalls because it is the iconic look for a cave miner.
