# Assignment5_Maze
I modeled my maze game after a cave because there is always a claustrophobic and liminal feeling of a cave. This feeling of a cave is just like the feeling of a maze. I also chose a blue colour for the crystals because it feels more magical and bright. Finally, I made a miner in overalls because it is the iconic look for a cave miner. 

For this assignment, I used Pixilart because I already had experience of using this website, and it also had a nice UI. I also used Unity because it is the required game engine that we had to use, and it is also very user friendly. Finally, I used github
